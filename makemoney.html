    <h1> There are many platforms to sell shoes on in todays world. But, the three most popular are eBay, 
        GOAT and StockX. All three of these platforms include authentication services, so that both the buyer 
        and seller will never get scammed by someone trying to sell fake shoes. All of these platforms have the 
        ability for sellers to set their own price, and buyers to bid on them. Selling on eBay is one of the most 
        profitable for both the buyer and seller, since any pair sold over $100 will have no seller fees. This also 
        comes with a free authentication service. While shipping may take slightly longer than any other platform, it 
        is the cheapest overall.  </h1>

        <h1> GOAT and StockX both have varying fees, depending on how much one sells. GOAT charges a seller fee and a commission fee of 9.5%, 
            but this rate goes down for the more you sell. StockX charges a 3% payment-processing fee as well as a transaction 
            fee of $14. Both of these websites guarantee authentic shoes, and enables the buyer to make disputes if the product they received is not legit.   </h1>
