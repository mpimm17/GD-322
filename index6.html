    <h1>There are two main factors for the emergence of collectable sneakers: basketball and hip hop music. 
        Michael Jordanâ€™s first Nike shoes were released in 1985, and were banned by the NBA for violating their color rules. 
        Nike took this event and ran with it, saying that the NBA banned them for giving Jordan an advantage over his opponents.
         Nike then paid a $5,000 fine every game that Jordan wore them in. </h1>
