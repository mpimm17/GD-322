    <h1>There are two main factors for the emergence of collectable sneakers: basketball and hip hop music. 
        Michael Jordan’s first Nike shoes were released in 1985, and were banned by the NBA for violating their color rules. 
        Nike took this event and ran with it, saying that the NBA banned them for giving Jordan an advantage over his opponents.
         Nike then paid a $5,000 fine every game that Jordan wore them in. </h1>

        <h1> Adidas got a boost in its popularity due to RUN-DMC’s song “My Adidas”, which made fans run out 
            and obsess over their “shell toes”. This trio donned black and white Adidas track suits with white Superstar 
            sneakers, which is still a staple in some people wardrobe to this day. Other major influences on the sneaker
             collecting community includes Kanye West and his Yeezy line of clothing and sneakers, Virgil Abloh with his 
             OFF—WHITE x Nike collab sneakers, Travis Scott and basketball players such 
             and LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant.</h1>
