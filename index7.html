    <h1>Many brands are popular right now, but the emergence of Nike dunks and the
        Jordan 1 are by far the most popular. Nike dunks were made originally for skateboarding, 
        and many find them not only stylish, but comfortable to wear for prolonged periods of time. 
        Jordan 1’s are also very popular once again, due to their influence on the culture, and timeless design. 
        Entering raffles on the Nike SNKRS app or Adidas confirmed app is the only chance that someone has to getting 
        these rare shoes for retail price.  </h1>
